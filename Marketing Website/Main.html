      <span></span>
      <p>The map screen is the main page of the app and is similar to any other map application allowing it to feel familiar and simple to use.
      You can tap on a pin to view the name of it, a brief summary and an image of the location, furthermore you can get directions to the 
      location (this will open google maps externally).</p>

      <h2>Searching for a Location</h2>
      <span></span>
      <p>The intuitive search screen allows for a user to easily view information about nearby locations and the ditance to them. If the user 
      only wants to view locations up to a certain distance from them then they can use the slider at the top to be able to do this. The checkboxes 
      at the top allow for further refinement of the search, such as only showing places that are child or wheelchair friendly. Finally the search 
      bar allows a user to search for a place or by location type (castle, theatre, etc).</p>
